# bibliontech_php

BiblionTech is a marketplace for used books. This is a project not for production but only for educational purposes. We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the design side, PHP for the backend one and Stripe integration as payment provider (File uploaded not include the stripe folder and payment folder because of vendor files that are too many).
